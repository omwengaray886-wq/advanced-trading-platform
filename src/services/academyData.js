# Welcome to Pre-School! 🍼
Grab your security blanket and favorite teddy bear! You're about to enter the most ginormous financial market in the world.

### What is Forex?
If you've ever traveled to another country, you usually had to find a currency exchange booth at the airport. You notice a screen displaying different exchange rates. You find "Japanese yen" and think, "WOW! My one dollar is worth 100 yen?! I'm going to be rich!!!" (Then you buy a soda and half your money is gone).

When you do this, you've participated in the **Forex market!** You've exchanged one currency for another.

### The Monster Comparison 🦖
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) trades about $74 billion a day. Sounds big, right? 

But compare it to the Foreign Exchange market, which trades **$4 TRILLION** a day. The NYSE is like a puny little kitten compared to the Godzilla of Forex!

*Corny Joke of the Day: Why did the forex trader get fired from the calendar factory? He took a day off!*

# Still in Pre-School: What are we actually trading?
The simple answer is **MONEY.**

Because you're not buying anything physical, it can be confusing. Think of buying a currency as buying a **share** in a particular country, kinda like buying stocks of a company. 

When you buy the Japanese yen, you are basically buying a "share" in the Japanese economy. You are betting that the Japanese economy is doing well and will get better.

Forex trading is the simultaneous buying of one currency and selling another. Currencies are traded in **pairs**.

### The Tug of War

# Grade 1: No more diapers! 🎓
Unlike the NYSE, the forex spot market has neither a physical location nor a central exchange. 

It is considered an **Over-the-Counter (OTC)**, or "Interbank" market because the entire market is run electronically within a network of banks, continuously over a 24-hour period.

### The Dollar is King 👑
The USD is king! It is on one side of a ridiculous **84.9%** of all reported transactions. 
- The US economy is the LARGEST in the world.
- The USD is the reserve currency of the world.
- Oil is priced in USD.

*Note: If Mexico wants to buy oil from Saudi Arabia, they have to sell pesos and buy dollars first!*

### 3. Options
Gives you the *right* but not the *obligation* to trade.

### 4. ETFs
Youngest members of the forex world. Created by financial institutions and traded like stocks.

The object is to exchange one currency for another expecting the price to change.

### Long vs. Short
- **Long (Buy)**: You buy the base currency and sell the quote. You want the price to go UP.
- **Short (Sell)**: You sell the base currency and buy the quote. You want the price to go DOWN.

### Bid/Ask & Spread
- **Bid**: The price your broker is willing to BUY from you.
- **Ask**: The price your broker is willing to SELL to you.
- **Spread**: The difference between the two. That's how the broker makes their bread.

Let's do some math (Don't run away!).

### What is a Pip?
A "Percentage in Point". It's the unit of measurement for value change. 
- If EUR/USD moves from 1.2250 to 1.2251, that's **1 Pip**.
- **Pipette**: A fractional pip (5th decimal place).

### What is a Japanese Candlestick?
[CANDLE_ANATOMY]

### Lots 📦
- **Standard Lot**: 100,000 units.
- **Mini Lot**: 10,000 units.
- **Micro Lot**: 1,000 units.

### Leverage 🦾
Using borrowed capital. A 100:1 leverage means you can control $100,000 with just a $1,000 deposit. It's a double-edged sword!

# Welcome to College! 🏛️
Learning never ends. To be a master, you need all three analysis types:

1. **Technical Analysis**: Studying price movement and charts. "History tends to repeat itself."
2. **Fundamental Analysis**: Analyzing economic, social, and political forces. (GDP, Interest rates).
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Gauging how the market "feels" (Bullish or Bearish).

### Support and Resistance
- **Support**: The "floor" that holds price up.
- **Resistance**: The "ceiling" that keeps price down.

[SR_BOUNCE]

### The Bounce and The Break
- **Trading the Bounce**: Wait for confirmation before entering.
- **Trading the Break**: Can be aggressive (on the break) or conservative (waiting for a retest).

### Trend Lines and Channels
Connect the peaks for resistance and valleys for support. Don't force them to fit!

            ### Break of Structure (BOS)
            BOS occurs when price closes beyond a previous structural high/low. It indicates the continuation of the current trend.
            
            ### Change of Character (CHoCH)
            CHoCH is the first sign of a potential reversal. It occurs when price fails to maintain the current structural trend and breaks the counter-structural point.
